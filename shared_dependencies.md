1. Unity ML Agents: This is a shared dependency across all the files as they are all part of the Unity ML Agents framework. It is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning environments.

2. PyDearGUI: This is a shared dependency across all the files as it is the GUI framework being used for the application. It will be used to create the user interface for the node editor, behavior tree editor, observations editor, and actions editor.

3. Node: This is a shared dependency across NodeEditor.py, BehaviorTreeEditor.py, ObservationsEditor.py, and ActionsEditor.py. It represents the basic unit of the behavior tree.

4. BehaviorTree: This is a shared dependency across NodeEditor.py and BehaviorTreeEditor.py. It represents the behavior tree structure.

5. Observations: This is a shared dependency across NodeEditor.py and ObservationsEditor.py. It represents the observations that the agent can make in the environment.

6. Actions: This is a shared dependency across NodeEditor.py and ActionsEditor.py. It represents the actions that the agent can take in the environment.

7. id names: These are shared across all the files that use JavaScript. They are used to identify DOM elements that JavaScript functions will interact with. The exact names will depend on the specific elements in the user interface, but they could include names like "nodeEditor", "behaviorTreeEditor", "observationsEditor", and "actionsEditor".

8. Message names: These are shared across all the files that use a messaging system for communication between different parts of the application. The exact names will depend on the specific messages being sent, but they could include names like "nodeCreated", "nodeDeleted", "behaviorTreeUpdated", "observationAdded", and "actionTaken".

9. Function names: These are shared across all the files that define or use functions. The exact names will depend on the specific functionality of the application, but they could include names like "createNode", "deleteNode", "updateBehaviorTree", "addObservation", and "takeAction".
